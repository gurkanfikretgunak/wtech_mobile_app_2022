## WTECH Mobile App '22 (non-profit development)

### Description

It is a very nice product of teamwork, which is the most beautiful point of the eight-week mobile application development adventure. The work was carried out entirely by "volunteer" developers within the scope of the training they learned. It will help many people who are out of the scope of education to try to publish the achievements in a completely open source manner so that many developers can be inspired within the scope of this study. The development here is planned as a sample project. And it is fully open source. The logos used and similar processes are used because they are under the same roof. The aim in this process is to inspire many developers at the point of open source development

Here, the participants came together and carried out the teamwork process by using the version management system. The developers designed the relevant screens based on the tasks undertaken by the selected people. They also presented how more than one team member worked in a single project as an example.

### Contributing

It is a project given as a group within the scope of training. Released as open source for all developers to benefit from with contributions from Women in Techonology association.
